## [v0.3.0] - 2021-11-26

### changed

- warning when exceeding 512 chars now shows offending SPF domain name
- "seen before"-warning changed into "multiple entries"-warning (less confusing)
- parser errors now correctly logged as :parse-errors instead of :eval-errors

### added

- warning about inconsistent qualifiers in case of multiple entries
- warning about mx used while domain has null MX record
- warning for superfluous prefix lengths (/32 resp. /128)
- warning for zero prefix lengths (/0)


## [v0.2.0] - 2021-11-21

### Changed

- verdict output includes owner domain and contact (also in csv-output)
- ipt logs show spf terms rather than their raw token
- logging to stderr now shows the domain in front, so redirecting stderr to a
  log file means the messages can be related to the domain being checked at
  that time.
- added warning when ?all or +all is used

### Fixed

- url for rfc7208 test suite
- use :dns (not :ipt) when logging dns additions to the cache
